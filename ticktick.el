;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; ticktick.el provides two-way synchronization between TickTick
;; (a popular task management service) and Emacs Org Mode.
;;
;; FEATURES:
;;
;; - Bidirectional sync: changes in either TickTick or Org Mode are reflected
;;   in both systems
;; - Task deletion synchronization: deletions on one side propagate to the other
;; - Configurable deletion behavior: ask, archive, or auto-delete
;; - OAuth2 authentication with automatic token refresh
;; - Preserves task metadata: priorities, due dates, completion status,
;;   descriptions, and tags
;; - Project-based organization matching TickTick's structure
;; - Optional automatic syncing on focus changes and timer-based intervals
;; - Tag synchronization using Org mode's native tag syntax
;;
;; SETUP:
;;
;; 1. Register a TickTick OAuth application at:
;;    https://developer.ticktick.com/
;;
;; 2. Configure your credentials:
;;    (setq ticktick-client-id "your-client-id")
;;    (setq ticktick-client-secret "your-client-secret")
;;
;;    `ticktick-client-secret' also accepts a function of no arguments,
;;    to fetch it on demand from auth-source.  See the README.
;;
;; 3. Authorize the application:
;;    M-x ticktick-authorize
;;
;; 4. Perform initial sync:
;;    M-x ticktick-sync
;;
;; USAGE:
;;
;; Main commands:
;; - `ticktick-sync': Full bidirectional sync (includes deletion sync)
;; - `ticktick-fetch-to-org': Pull tasks from TickTick to Org
;; - `ticktick-push-from-org': Push Org tasks to TickTick
;; - `ticktick-authorize': Set up OAuth authentication
;; - `ticktick-refresh-token': Manually refresh auth token
;; - `ticktick-toggle-sync-timer': Toggle automatic timer-based syncing
;; - `ticktick-delete-task-at-point': Delete task at cursor from both sides
;; - `ticktick-show-sync-state': View current synchronization state
;; - `ticktick-retry-failed-deletions': Retry any failed deletion operations
;; - `ticktick-clear-sync-state': Reset sync state (use if corrupted)
;;
;; Tasks are stored in the file specified by `ticktick-sync-file'
;; (defaults to ~/.emacs.d/ticktick/ticktick.org) with this structure:
;;
;; * Project Name
;; :PROPERTIES:
;; :TICKTICK_PROJECT_ID: abc123
;; :END:
;; ** TODO Task Title [#A]                                    :work:urgent:
;; DEADLINE: <2024-01-15 Mon>
;; :PROPERTIES:
;; :TICKTICK_ID: def456
;; :TICKTICK_ETAG: xyz789
;; :SYNC_CACHE: hash
;; :LAST_SYNCED: 2025-01-15T10:30:00+0000
;; :END:
;; Task description content here.
;;
;; CUSTOMIZATION:
;;
;; Key variables you can customize:
;; - `ticktick-sync-file': Path to the org file for tasks
;; - `ticktick-dir': Directory for storing tokens and data
;; - `ticktick-autosync': Enable automatic syncing on focus changes
;; - `ticktick-sync-interval': Enable automatic syncing every N minutes
;; - `ticktick-httpd-port': Port for OAuth callback server
;; - `ticktick-delete-behavior': How to handle deletions (ask/archive/delete/sync-only)
;; - `ticktick-archive-location': Where to archive deleted tasks (separate-file/archive-heading)
;; - `ticktick-archive-file': Path to archive file for deleted tasks
;; - `ticktick-confirm-deletions': Whether to prompt for deletion confirmation
;; - `ticktick-deletion-conflict-policy': How to resolve modify-delete conflicts
;;
;; For debugging OAuth issues:
;; M-x ticktick-debug-oauth
